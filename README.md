# PubSub Microservice System

A Pub/Sub-based microservice architecture using **NestJS**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, **Docker**. This system consists of:

- **Receiver Service**: Accepts user data via HTTP POST, stores it in MongoDB, and publishes it to Redis.
- **Listener Service**: Subscribes to Redis channel, processes the message, and stores it in MongoDB.
